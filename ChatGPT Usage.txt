# ChatGPT Usage Transparency

This project was developed with the assistance of ChatGPT as a productivity and learning aid, in line with the assignment guidelines.

1) How ChatGPT Was Used
ChatGPT was used in the following ways during development:

- Generating boilerplate code for standard components such as WebSocket ingestion setup, data loading, and basic function templates.
- Assisting with debugging runtime errors, library-related issues (e.g., pandas resampling, timestamp parsing, Streamlit integration), and edge cases encountered during live data processing.
- Helping structure the project into modular components (ingestion, storage, resampling, analytics, and frontend) to improve readability and extensibility.

2) What Was Not Delegated to ChatGPT
The following aspects were independently reasoned, implemented, and validated:

- Overall system architecture and data flow design.
- Selection of analytics (hedge ratio via OLS, spread, z-score, rolling correlation, ADF test) based on the problem context.
- Decisions around resampling strategy, live-data safeguards, and handling of insufficient data scenarios.
- Integration of all components into a working end-to-end application and validation through live runs.

3)Prompts and Interaction Style
ChatGPT was primarily used through iterative, targeted prompts focused on:
- Understanding error messages and resolving them correctly.
- Verifying statistical concepts and their correct implementation.
- Improving code clarity and defensive handling of live-system edge cases.

The final codebase reflects a clear understanding of all components and does not rely on opaque or unverified AI-generated logic.
